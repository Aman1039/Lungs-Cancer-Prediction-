Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning
Lung Cancer Prediction

Welcome to the Lung Cancer Prediction Project repository!
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on input features. 
Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes, and this project aims to assist medical professionals in making more informed decisions.
Introduction
This project aims to predict lung cancer using a machine-learning approach. By utilizing a dataset of clinical and patient data, we have developed a predictive model that can assist medical practitioners in identifying individuals who may be at higher risk for lung cancer.
