Lung Cancer Prediction Project

Overview

The Lung Cancer Prediction project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict lung cancer outcomes based on pertinent features extracted from two distinct datasets, labeled as Dataset-1 and Dataset-2. The primary aim is to assess the efficacy of various feature selection algorithms and hyperparameter tuning strategies across a diverse set of machine learning models.

Datasets

Dataset-1
The first dataset, Dataset-1, comprises selected features derived from four feature selection algorithms: Pearson Correlation, Mutual Information Score, Select K Best, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). These features are then evaluated across seven machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, Gradient Boost, and AdaBoost.

Dataset-2
The second dataset, Dataset-2, extends the analysis by examining the performance of selected features obtained from three feature selection algorithms: utilizing all features, Mutual Information Score, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Similar to Dataset-1, these features are assessed across seven machine learning models under scenarios with and without hyperparameter tuning.
