## Datasets

### Dataset-1
- **Description:** This dataset comprises selected features derived from four feature selection algorithms:
  - **Pearson Correlation**
  - **Mutual Information Score**
  - **Select K Best**
  - **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**

- **Models Used:** The selected features are evaluated across seven machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Naïve Bayes
  - Gradient Boost
  - AdaBoost

### Dataset-2
- **Description:** This dataset extends the analysis by examining the performance of selected features obtained from three feature selection algorithms:
  - **All Features**
  - **Mutual Information Score**
  - **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**

- **Models Used:** Similar to Dataset-1, these features are assessed across the same seven machine learning models under scenarios with and without hyperparameter tuning.
